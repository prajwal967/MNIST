# Introduction to Deep Learning for Image Recognition (MNIST Dataset)

This repo accompanies the *Introduction to Deep Learning for Image Recognition* to explain the core concepts of deep learning with emphasis on classifying images as the application. `Python` is used
 
## Overview

The following topics are covered

1. What is deep learning?
2. Motivation: Some use cases 
3. Building blocks of Neural Networks (Neuron, Activation Function, Backpropagation Algorithm)
4. Introduction to the problem : MNIST dataset
5. Building neural network from scratch
5. Introduction to `keras`
6. Multi-layer perceptron
7. Convolutional Neural Network

## Project

The project involved comparing how the performance varies for a Multi Layer Perceptron or Convolution Neural Network by varying the number of layers, adding dropout, varying max pooling and using different activation functions. +
Auto Encoders demonstrates how unsupervised learning can be used in image recognition, although the performance is not as good as supervised learning. +
Image augmentation, is increasing the size of the given dataset by rotating the images in the dataset, this could help improve accuracy.
